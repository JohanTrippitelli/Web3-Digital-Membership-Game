# DripQ - Web3 Smart Contract for Dynamic Memberships

**Welcome to DripQ's repository!** We're here to revolutionize fashion consumption with dynamic memberships represented by a deck of cards. This README gives you an overview of our project, its features, market analysis, team, and future plans.

## Project Overview

**DripQ introduces a fresh concept** where users interact with a gamified fashion market, changing how clothes are bought and enjoyed. With web3 technology and smart contracts, DripQ offers dynamic memberships that can be traded, upgraded, and swapped effortlessly. Memberships come as a deck of cards, each tier granting access to exclusive clothing products.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Memberships**: Users buy memberships as NFTs, unlocking the full app experience.
- **Gamified Shopping**: Users swipe through clothes, indicating preferences and influencing production.
- **NFT Representation**: Memberships are NFTs, enabling digital sale and resale.
- **Membership Tiers**: Thirteen tiers offer access to exclusive clothing.
